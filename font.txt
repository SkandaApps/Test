You are invited to help us celebrate 20 years of automotive service to the residents of Monroe County. We are happy to be the number one dealer in both sales and service for the State of Kansas. It's something we have worked hard to accomplish. Please drop in at 1600 Main Street during the month of June to enjoy summer refreshments and see the latest models. While you are there, remember to register for our big July giveaway.

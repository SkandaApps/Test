I'd like to introduce James Gonzalez who is starting at Johnson's as a product specialist on May 1. John will work in the marketing department where he will report to Sherri Howell. His job responsibilities will include coordinating all marketing services for the xx product.

He'll work with the product development team on all aspects of developing the product through launching the product in the international markets.

We've hired John to carry out our new vision of how product development needs to involve making a business case and market for the product before we make a single widget. This gives us the opportunity to see what potential customers really want and need before we build products.

John has worked in the area of bringing products to market for two different employers during his career so far. He is enthusiastic and excited about our new approach that will involve him very early in the product development cycle, an approach he believes will revolutionize our sales.

John's degree is from LaSalle University where he majored in marketing and minored in business.

Join me in welcoming John. He'll work with the other product specialist, Mary Robertson, who will serve as his official mentor. You will find John in the office right next to Mary's in the marketing wing. I've attached John's picture so that you will be able to recognize and greet him.

You can reach John on extension 543 and he spends a lot of time in AIM as johngonzalez222. He's also an enthusiastic player of all sports so let him know who needs a team member.

Regards,

Jerry Lee
Department Manager
